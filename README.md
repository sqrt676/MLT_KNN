# Machine Learning Techniques

Hello everyone , i am sqrt676 (Sumit Pandey)
here i will put down the different algorithms i studied as part of my Machine learning technique course
this course is part of syllabus in B.tech (AKTU , lucknow) as well as IIT madras data science diploma course
#the course is BSCCS2007 in IIT MADRAS

Moreover I am doing this work of studying the algo, understanding and coding it to gain practical knowledge on my own will and is not part of any assignment etc.

Let us look at different algo discussed in this repository.
Thank You

A. KNN: it contains a python notebook written in jupyter book under the hood of vs code to understand apply concepts of K nearest neighbour to find prediction of diabetes and test accuracy at different values of K
B. LWR- locally weighted regression LWR
 1. it works where linear regression fails due to non linear relationship b/w X and Y
 2. it is a supervised learning algo
 3. non parametric in broad sense.
 4. it's memory based, calculation of cost function is done using weight W(i),
   where W(i) is non negative constant , directly proportional to the viscinity
